Q1.1: 
ReflexAgent first checks all of the legal moves pacman can make and then determines
the best action based on an evaluation function. The original evaluation function did not update 
the "score" for each action, resulting in random moves. The updated evaluation function takes into
account pacman's proximity to food, giving actions closer to food a higher score. The updated 
evaulation function also gives a huge penalty of the action places pacman next to a ghost since that
could potentially mean game over. With these updates, pacman beats the single ghost everytime and
sometimes even beats the two ghosts.



Q1.2:
d = distance to food 
g = number ghosts pacman is next to
s = number of turns pacman stops

score = score + 10/d - 10s - 1000g 

This makes sense because the function returns higher values when pacman is moving and getting
closer to food, which would get higher scores. It also returns lower values when pacman stops or 
encounters a ghost, which could end the game or make it go on forever.



Q2.1: 
MinimaxAgent runs getAction, which calls the minimax function. This is a recursive function that
continues until it hits a base case: pacman wins, loses, or search hits the max depth allowed. This works
because once the base case is reached, the returned values from the base of the recursion tree travel back 
up to the root, alternating between being minimized and maximized by the ghosts and pacman until the 
optimal score and action returns to the root.
